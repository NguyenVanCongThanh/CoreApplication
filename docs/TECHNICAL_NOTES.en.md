# ⚠️ Technical Notes — What Developers Must Know Before Building

> This document dives deep into the **critical technical issues** within the codebase — things that aren't obvious at first glance but will cause the application to **fail to run**, **fail silently**, or **introduce serious security vulnerabilities** if overlooked. Read carefully before your first build.

## 1. JWT — Sharing the Secret Between Two Backends

### The Problem

JWT tokens are **created by Spring Boot** (Auth Service) but **verified by both Spring Boot and Go** (LMS Service). Both services use the same secret to sign and verify tokens. If the secrets differ, every request from the frontend to the LMS will be rejected with `401 Unauthorized` — and this error is extremely hard to diagnose if you don't know to look for it.

### How It Works in Code

**Spring Boot** (`JwtService.java`) — signs the token on login:

```java
@Value("${jwt.secret}")
private String jwtSecret;

// Token contains: email (subject), user_id, role
public String generateToken(Long userId, String email, String role) {
    return Jwts.builder()
        .subject(email)
        .claim("user_id", userId)
        .claim("role", role)
        .signWith(secretKey)  // ← signed with JWT_SECRET
        .compact();
}
```

**Go** (`config.go`) — reads the same secret to verify:

```go
JWT: JWTConfig{
    Secret: getEnv("JWT_SECRET", "very_secret_key_change_me_please"),
},
```

Go also **validates** the secret length at startup:

```go
if len(c.JWT.Secret) < 32 {
    return fmt.Errorf("JWT secret must be at least 32 characters")
}
```

If `JWT_SECRET` is shorter than 32 characters → **the LMS service will fail to start**.

### Correct `.env` Configuration

```env
# Must be IDENTICAL and >= 32 characters in both services
JWT_SECRET=this-is-a-secret-string-at-least-32-chars-long

# Spring Boot uses milliseconds
JWT_EXPIRATION_MS=3600000       # 1 hour

# Go uses hours (a completely separate variable)
# JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS=1        # defaults to 1, usually no need to set
```

> ⚠️ **Important note on expiration:** Spring Boot uses `JWT_EXPIRATION_MS` (in ms), Go uses `JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS` (in hours). These are **completely independent variables**. Since tokens are created by Spring Boot, the actual expiry time is determined by `JWT_EXPIRATION_MS`.

### Quick Verification

```bash
# Step 1: Get a token from the Auth service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"password"}'

# Step 2: Use that token to call the LMS service
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_FROM_STEP_1>"

# If you get 401 → JWT_SECRET doesn't match between services
```

## 2. Email — Gmail SMTP Configuration

### The Problem

Email is used for two key features: **sending temporary passwords** when creating users in bulk (`bulkRegister`) and **sending confirmation links** when resetting passwords (`PasswordResetService`). The dangerous part: if email is misconfigured, `bulkRegister` **still returns HTTP 200 success** but users never receive their password — they can't log in and have no way to recover access.

### Getting a Google App Password — Required

Gmail **blocks logins** from third-party apps using your regular Gmail password. You **must** use an App Password:

1. Visit https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** if not already done
3. Find **"App passwords"** → Create new
4. Select: App = "Mail", Device = "Other" → Name it "BDC Server"
5. Google generates a password like `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx` — **remove the spaces when using it** (16 characters total)

```env
EMAIL=your-account@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx    # 16-char App Password, no spaces
APP_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Verifying Email Works

```bash
# Create a test user to see if an email is sent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"users":[{"name":"Test User","email":"your-test@gmail.com","role":"ROLE_USER"}]}'
```

Check the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep -i email
# Success: INFO  AuthService - Welcome email sent to: your-test@gmail.com
# Failure: ERROR AuthService - Failed to send email to: your-test@gmail.com
```

### Running Locally Without Sending Real Emails

Use [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) — a lightweight local email catcher that intercepts all outgoing mail:

```bash
docker run -d -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 axllent/mailpit
```

View mail at: http://localhost:8025 (clean web interface, zero extra configuration needed).

> When using Mailpit, override SMTP config via environment variables: `SPRING_MAIL_HOST=localhost`, `SPRING_MAIL_PORT=1025`.

## 3. CORS — Configured in Three Places

### The Problem

This is the most common gotcha. CORS is **hardcoded in two Java files** and controlled by **one environment variable in Go**. When you add a new domain, change a port, or develop on a different URL, you must update **all three places** — miss any one of them and the frontend will be blocked by CORS errors.

### The Three Places to Update

**Place 1** — `CorsConfig.java` (Spring Boot):

```java
registry.addMapping("/**")
    .allowedOrigins(
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://localhost:8080",
        "https://bdc.hpcc.vn",
        "http://frontend:3000"   // ← Docker internal hostname
    )
```

**Place 2** — `SecurityConfig.java` (Spring Boot):

```java
config.setAllowedOrigins(List.of(
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "https://bdc.hpcc.vn",
    "http://frontend:3000"   // ← Must match CorsConfig
));
```

> `SecurityConfig.corsConfigurationSource()` takes priority as it's registered directly in the Spring Security filter chain. Both files should have identical lists to avoid confusion.

**Place 3** — `config.go` (Go LMS), read from environment variable:

```go
AllowedOrigins: getEnvAsSlice("CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS", []string{
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://frontend:3000",
    "https://bdc.hpcc.vn",
})
```

```env
# Comma-separated, NO spaces
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://frontend:3000,https://bdc.hpcc.vn
```

### When to Update All Three Places

- Adding a new production domain
- Running the frontend on a different port (e.g., 3001)
- Adding a mobile app or new client
- Developing on a staging environment

### Symptoms of Incorrect CORS

The browser console will show:

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8080/api/...' from origin 'http://localhost:3000'
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header
```

→ Check whether your origin is in the allowedOrigins list in all three places.

> 💡 **Long-term improvement:** Both Java files should read `allowedOrigins` from environment variables (like Go already does) rather than hardcoding. See [Section 8.3](#❌-83--cors-production-domain-hardcoded-in-java).

## 4. User Sync — Asynchronous Sync, Easy to Miss

### The Problem

When a user is created via `bulkRegister`, Spring Boot calls `userSyncService.syncUsersToLms()` to sync the user to Go LMS. This function runs **asynchronously (`@Async`)** — which means:

1. `bulkRegister` returns HTTP 200 success **immediately**
2. Sync runs in the background; if it fails, it only **logs the error — no exception is thrown**
3. The user exists in Auth DB but **does not exist in LMS DB**
4. Consequence: the user cannot enroll in any course because the LMS doesn't know they exist

### Authentication via Header

Sync requests are protected by the `X-Sync-Secret` header:

```java
// UserSyncService.java — Spring Boot sends
headers.set("X-Sync-Secret", lmsApiSecret);   // variable: LMS_API_SECRET
```

```go
// main.go — Go LMS receives and validates
syncSecret := os.Getenv("LMS_SYNC_SECRET")
sync.Use(syncHandler.SyncSecret())  // middleware checks the header
```

**`LMS_API_SECRET` (Spring Boot) must equal `LMS_SYNC_SECRET` (Go).** If they differ → every sync is rejected with `403 Forbidden`, but since the error is caught and only logged → it's extremely hard to notice.

### Correct Configuration

```env
# Values MUST be equal
LMS_API_SECRET=your-sync-secret-string
LMS_SYNC_SECRET=your-sync-secret-string
```

### Checking Whether Sync Works

```bash
# Check lms-backend logs after creating users
docker compose logs lms-backend | grep -iE "sync"

# Success:
# INFO: Successfully synced user user@example.com to LMS

# Failure (sync rejected):
# ERROR: Failed to sync user user@example.com to LMS: 403 Forbidden
```

### Manual Sync When Needed

If the LMS was down when users were created in bulk, they won't be synced. Trigger a manual sync:

```bash
# Sync a specific user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/sync/user \
  -H "X-Sync-Secret: <LMS_SYNC_SECRET>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":123,"email":"user@example.com","full_name":"Nguyen Van A","roles":["TEACHER","STUDENT"]}'

# Sync all users
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/sync/users/bulk \
  -H "X-Sync-Secret: <LMS_SYNC_SECRET>"
```

### Role Mapping During Sync

Special logic in `UserSyncService.java` — important to understand:

```java
private List<String> determineRoles(UserRole userRole) {
    List<String> roles = new ArrayList<>();
    roles.add("TEACHER");   // All users get TEACHER in LMS
    roles.add("STUDENT");   // All users get STUDENT in LMS
    if (userRole == UserRole.ROLE_ADMIN) {
        roles.add("ADMIN"); // Only ADMINs get this extra role
    }
    return roles;
}
```

This is intentional design: every club member can both teach and learn.

## 5. Storage — Local vs MinIO

### The Problem

The LMS Service supports two file storage backends: **local filesystem** and **MinIO**. The default is local. If you don't configure things correctly when switching to MinIO — or if you forget to mount a volume when using local — uploads will be lost or files won't be served.

### Choosing a Storage Backend

```env
# Local (default) — suitable for development
STORAGE_TYPE=local
STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH=./uploads

# MinIO — recommended for production
STORAGE_TYPE=minio
MINIO_ENDPOINT=minio:9000          # Container name in Docker network
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin123
MINIO_BUCKET=lms-files
MINIO_USE_SSL=false
```

### Local Storage — Important Note

Files are saved **inside the container** at `/app/uploads`. If the container is deleted or recreated, **files are also lost**. The `docker-compose.yml` already configures a persistent volume:

```yaml
volumes:
  - lms_upload_data:/app/uploads   # Persistent Docker volume
```

When running Go directly on your machine (outside Docker), `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` defaults to `./uploads` in the `lms-service/` directory.

### MinIO — Important Note

MinIO must be **healthy** before LMS starts. However, in the current `docker-compose.yml`, `lms-backend` does **not** have MinIO in its `depends_on`. If using MinIO, add:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
lms-backend:
  depends_on:
    minio:
      condition: service_healthy   # ← Add this
```

### Accessing MinIO Console

```
URL:      http://localhost:9001
Username: value of MINIO_ROOT_USER in .env
Password: value of MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD in .env
```

MinIO automatically creates the bucket on LMS startup if it doesn't already exist.

## 6. DataInitializer — Default Admin Account

### The Problem

`DataInitializer.java` creates a default admin account when the database is **empty on first run**:

```java
if (userRepository.count() == 0) {
    User admin = User.builder()
        .email("phucnhan289@gmail.com")          // ← Hardcoded email
        .password(passwordEncoder.encode("hehehe"))  // ← Weak hardcoded password
        .role(UserRole.ROLE_ADMIN)
        .build();
    userRepository.save(admin);
}
```

### Workflow for New Developers

1. First run → empty database → DataInitializer creates the admin
2. Log in: `phucnhan289@gmail.com` / `hehehe`
3. **Change the email and password immediately** via the API or directly in the DB

```bash
# Connect to DB to update admin credentials
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d club_db

-- View current admin
SELECT id, email, role FROM users;

-- Update email
UPDATE users SET email = 'your-admin@example.com' WHERE role = 'ROLE_ADMIN';
```

### Workflow for Production

Before the first production deploy, update `DataInitializer.java` to read credentials from environment variables instead of hardcoding:

```java
.email(System.getenv("ADMIN_EMAIL"))
.password(passwordEncoder.encode(System.getenv("ADMIN_PASSWORD")))
```

After deploying, log in and change the password through the UI immediately. DataInitializer won't trigger again because `count() != 0`.

---

## 7. Password Reset — Token and Scheduler

### How It Works

```
User requests a password change
          │
          ▼
PasswordResetService.createToken(user)
  → Delete old tokens for this user (prevent parallel tokens)
  → Create a new UUID token
  → Token expires in 15 minutes
          │
          ▼
EmailService.sendPasswordChangeConfirmation(email, token)
  → Send link: {APP_PUBLIC_URL}/confirm-password-change?token=...
          │
          ▼
User clicks the link → confirm endpoint
  → validateAndGetToken(): check unused + not expired
  → markTokenAsUsed(): mark as used
  → Change password → Send success confirmation email
```

### Scheduled Cleanup Job

```java
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * * *")  // Runs at 2:00 AM every day
public void cleanupExpiredTokens() {
    tokenRepository.deleteByExpiryDateBefore(LocalDateTime.now());
}
```

`@EnableScheduling` must be present in your Spring Boot configuration for this job to run. Check `RestTemplateConfig.java` for this annotation if cleanup isn't working.

### Note on `APP_PUBLIC_URL`

The password reset link uses `APP_PUBLIC_URL`:

```java
String confirmUrl = appUrl + "/confirm-password-change?token=" + token;
```

If `APP_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000` → the link in the email is `http://localhost:3000/confirm-password-change?token=...`. When developing in a team environment, the email recipient must be able to reach that URL from their machine. Use your machine's IP or hostname instead of `localhost` in that scenario.

## 8. Security Issues to Fix Before Production

The following issues **currently exist in the code** and must be addressed before going to production.

### ❌ 8.1 — Debug logging in JwtAuthFilter

```java
// JwtAuthFilter.java — CURRENTLY IN CODE, needs to be removed
System.out.println("📥 Incoming Request: " + request.getMethod() + " " + request.getRequestURI());
System.out.println("📤 Response Status: " + response.getStatus());
```

This logs every request to stdout → excessive log noise, potentially exposing sensitive URL patterns. Remove it or replace with:

```java
log.debug("Incoming: {} {} → {}", request.getMethod(), request.getRequestURI(), response.getStatus());
```

### ❌ 8.2 — Stack trace exposed to client

```java
// GlobalExceptionHandler.java
return ResponseEntity.status(500)
    .body(Map.of(
        "error", ex.getMessage(),
        "type", ex.getClass().getName(),
        "trace", ex.getStackTrace()[0].toString()  // ← Exposes code structure!
    ));
```

Fix: hide error details in production, keep them only in development:

```java
if (isProduction) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(500).body(Map.of("error", "Internal server error"));
} else {
    // Keep full details for development
}
```

### ❌ 8.3 — CORS production domain hardcoded in Java

```java
// CorsConfig.java and SecurityConfig.java
.allowedOrigins("https://bdc.hpcc.vn", ...)  // ← Production domain hardcoded
```

Read from environment variables instead (like Go already does):

```java
@Value("${cors.allowed-origins}")
private List<String> allowedOrigins;
```

### ❌ 8.4 — `ex.printStackTrace()` in GlobalExceptionHandler

```java
ex.printStackTrace();  // ← Dumps full stack trace to logs
```

Replace with:

```java
log.error("Unhandled exception: {}", ex.getMessage(), ex);
```

### ⚠️ 8.5 — MinIO missing from `depends_on` in lms-backend

If using `STORAGE_TYPE=minio`, LMS may start before MinIO is ready and fail to initialize. Add:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
lms-backend:
  depends_on:
    minio:
      condition: service_healthy
```

## 9. Event-Driven AI (Kafka) — Handling API Timeouts

### The Problem
The traditional AI Request model (LMS performing an HTTP call to the FastAPI AI Service) often times out because generating Flashcards or Quizzes with LLMs and GPUs takes well over 10 - 30 seconds. The browser connection drops, leading to UI crashes and stuck backend request handlers.

### The Solution
We implemented an asynchronous Kafka Producer/Consumer architecture (Asynchronous Payload Processing):

```
LMS Producer (Push Command) ──► Kafka.lms.ai.command ──► AI Consumer Worker
                                                             │
LMS REST Endpoint ◄── Polling (Redis) ◄── LMS Consumer ◄── Kafka.ai.job.status
```

1. **ID Generation**: `lms-service` generates a random `job_id`.
2. **Acceptance**: `lms-service` returns a `202 Accepted` status alongside the `job_id` to the browser WITHOUT waiting for the AI response.
3. **Kafka Loop**: `ai-service` runs `kafka_worker.py` continuously listening to `lms.ai.command`, processes the LLM prompt, updates the DB, and publishes the result with the `job_id` to the `ai.job.status` topic.
4. **Redis Tracking**: `lms-service` continuously listens for all updates from `ai.job.status` and caches the state in `Redis` (using key: `ai_job:<id>`).
5. **Frontend Polling**: The UI purely calls `GET /api/v1/ai/jobs/<id>/status` at an interval until Redis reports `"status": "completed"`.

### Important Notes
- Do not hardcode AI commands via generic HTTP GET/POST if the logic exceeds 2s! Always employ this Event-Driven model.
- During Kafka Rebalances, ensure consumer `GroupID`s inside `lms-backend` **ARE DISTINCT**. For example: use `lms-service-ai-job-status-group` and `lms-service-document-group` to avoid stalling consumer messages.

## ✅ Security Checklist Before Go-Live

Run through this list before every production deployment:

- [ ] All secrets and passwords changed from defaults in `.env`
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` is >= 32 characters and identical in both backends
- [ ] `LMS_API_SECRET` equals `LMS_SYNC_SECRET`
- [ ] Default admin account email and password have been changed
- [ ] `System.out.println` removed from `JwtAuthFilter`
- [ ] Stack trace hidden in `GlobalExceptionHandler` for production
- [ ] `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` is >= 8 characters (MinIO requirement)
- [ ] `JPA_DDL_AUTO=validate` or `none` in production (never use `update`)
- [ ] `JPA_SHOW_SQL=false`
- [ ] `LOG_LEVEL=WARN` or `ERROR` in production to reduce log noise
